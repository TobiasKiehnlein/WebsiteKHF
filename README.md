# WebsiteKHF
This is a small project containing a simple html5, sass, javascript website

## Running
Simply install npm and node.
Then after a quick `npm i` you should be able to develop using `npm dev` and build using `npm build`.

## Feature Requests and suggestions
I'm very open to new ideas and suggestions... Just post them in the Issues tab as a Feature Request.

## Bugs
Hopefully there aren't any but probably there are. So just tell me with a Bug Report in the Issues tab.

## Contributing
Since this is a pretty small project with probably no interest I think there won't be any contributions.
But if you want to contribute feel free to do so.
